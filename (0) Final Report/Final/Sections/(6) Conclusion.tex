\section{Conclusion and Future Works}

The development and implementation of an XGBoost regression model for predicting
the finished lot price to land value ratio have demonstrated significant potential
in aiding land development decision-making. Rigorous hyperparameter tuning
ensured robust performance, with the model achieving an $R^{2}$ score of 0.91 on
the training set and 0.85 on the test set, along with a low Mean Squared Error (MSE).
These metrics indicate strong predictive capability and minimal overfitting,
making the model a reliable tool for early-stage project assessments.

While the model performs well, there are several avenues for future research and
development. Exploring advanced geospatial techniques or incorporating proximity-based
metrics (e.g., distance to amenities, transport hubs) could provide a deeper understanding
of location-specific influences. Developing a temporal model that accounts for
time-series data could help track and predict trends in the ratio over time, improving
its utility for long-term planning.
