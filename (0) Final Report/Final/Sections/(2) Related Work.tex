Gu et al. (2023) explored the application of machine learning models to predict
land development intensity, a critical metric for understanding the efficiency of
land use and guiding regional planning. Their study compared four
algorithms—XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree—and
found that XGBoost outperformed the others, achieving an $R^{2}$ of 95.66\% and an
MSE of 0.16. This research underscores the utility of XGBoost in modeling
complex relationships between natural, social, and economic factors influencing
land development.\cite{gu2023landdevelopment}.
