This project shows the import co relations between various amenities and features of listings in Seattle.
After employing analysis visualization and co relation methods we outlined the variables necessary for price prediction
We have predicted the price for listings by using machine learning method of KNN and Linear Regression. RMSE value helps in best possible implementation of KNN algorithm.The accuracy of predicted Price is judged by using distribution plots.
Though KNN Regression seems pretty accurate when using few regression variables for price prediction but we can employ various advance machine learning algorithms also for price prediction which would thence increase the accuracy thus further reducing variance. 
In future we can employ algorithms to also take into account classification qualitative data to get more precise analysis and prediction.
