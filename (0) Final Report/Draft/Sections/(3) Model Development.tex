\subsection{Initial Linear Regression Model}

An initial linear regression model with minimal computational overhead was developed to serve as a benchmark for predicting property sale prices and guide the early stages of developing the more complex model. At this stage, the focus is on understanding the relationships between key features, such as land acreage, market land values, and geographical coordinates to see how they influence sale prices. 

The code begins by loading and preprocessing the dataset, including handling missing values and standardizing numerical features for consistency and variance across features. It splits the data into training and testing sets based on the ratio mentioned above. A linear regression model is then trained on the processed features and targets to predict sale prices. Finally, the model's accuracy is assessed using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and $R^2$, providing insights into its predictive ability and areas for improvement.
